# Send-Email-Alerts-Python-SMTP

It is very important for data scientists to communicate reports to non-technical users particularly if the data contains any anomalies. Most analysts would manually submit business reports to users from my working experience; they would process the data, run some validations, and produce reports to be sent via Outlook/gmail. This all takes a lot of time and leaves space for human mistakes.

This project shows how to automate the process of sending a notification to you by e-mail when some changes happen!
